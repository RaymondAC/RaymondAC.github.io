    <p> Hi, my name is Alex Raymond.  I am orignially from Warren, NJ.  I have a degree in environmental science and some work towards my masters in environmental chemistry.  I am fairly outdoorsy and enjoy hiking, mountain biking, swimming, skiing and climbing.  I was employed by Leidos as an environmental consultant for the past three years but felt that big business was not the right fit for me and am now here looking into the start up world.
